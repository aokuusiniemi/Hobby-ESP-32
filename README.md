# Hobby-ESP-32

ESP32 hobby projects and experiments using the Arduino IDE.

This repository contains sketches, wiring notes, and small projects (OLED, animations, sensors, Wi-Fi, etc.) created while learning embedded development and IoT.

The goal is to build **local-first, cloud-optional devices**, avoiding unnecessary dependence on platforms that collect or monetize user data.
